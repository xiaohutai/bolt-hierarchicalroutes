# Menu
# ----
# The menu structure defined in `app/config/menu.yml` to use for hierarchical
# routes. Use a name or an array of menu names.

menu: main
# menu: [ main, aside, footer ]


# Rules
# -----
# Configure additional rules for handling items dynamically. Think of rules such
# as: "blog posts of a certain category must fall under a specific parent".
#
# The most specific rules need to be on top. Currently, there are two types:
#
# - `contenttype`: Applies the rule a whole contenttype, and is not constrained
#                  by a limit. This is a simple, generic and fast check.
#
# - `query`: Applies the rule to a setcontent-like query, note that this query
#            may have an implicit limit. This requires the records to be fetched
#            from the database.

rules:
    # - type: query
    #   params:
    #     query: "showcases"
    #     parameters: { limit: 10, tags: 'sports' }
    #     parent: "entry/1"
    # - type: contenttype
    #   params:
    #     slug: "pages"
    #     parent: "entry/1"


# Settings
# --------
# overwrite-duplicates: Whether to overwrite when a duplicate entry has been
#                       found. Basically always overwrite (keep last value)
#                       versus never overwrite (keep first value).
#
#                       Note that this handling of duplicates does not make much
#                       sense. There _should_ be no duplicates. This feature
#                       might change in the future.
#
# override-slugs: Allow (slugifized) names in `menu.yml` override the slugs
#                 defined in the records.
# enable-routing: If you want to make use of hierarchies, but not the routing.
#                 When using Bolt Translate, the Bolt Translate routing should
#                 take over, so set this to `false`. Bolt Translate integration
#                 is not working.
# bypass-url-generator: Bypasses the URL generator. This is generally kept `false`.

settings:
    overwrite-duplicates : true
    override-slugs       : false
    enable-routing       : true
    bypass-url-generator : false
